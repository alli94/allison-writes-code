# Allison Writes Code (a blog and portfolio of sorts)
Learning how to build my own responsive website using html, css, 
a sprinkling of javascript, and figuring out how to use a crm for 
easier blog hosting. Nunjucks is intense at first (ahaha many 
silly errors due to 1. not understanding templates or frameworks, 
and 2. chatgpt, while a great tool, can potentially gum up code if
you're not paying attention :0)

Anyhow, it's looking cute so far! Can't wait to figure out the next
step :)
