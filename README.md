# Allison Writes Code (a blog and portfolio of sorts)
Learning how to build my own responsive website using html, css, 
a sprinkling of javascript, and figuring out how to use a crm for 
easier blog hosting. Nunjucks is intense at first (ahaha many 
silly errors due to 1. not understanding templates or frameworks, 
and 2. chatgpt, while a great tool, can potentially gum up code if
you're not paying attention :0)

Anyhow, it's looking cute so far! Can't wait to figure out the next
step :)

OH MY the world of Nunjucks is wild... probably not the best first choice 
for site building. However, following a Kevin Powell tutorial has been (mostly)
straitforward. Running into a problem with presenting the markdown files for 
blogposts onto the site with proper formatting... not sure why it's not working.
Will be rewatching the video to see if I missed any steps and do some 
googling from there!
