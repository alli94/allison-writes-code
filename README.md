# Allison Writes Code (a blog and portfolio of sorts)
Build my own responsive website using html, css, a sprinkling of javascript, 
and a CMS for easier blog hosting. Also figured out how to use Nunjucks and 11ty
to create templates. After previously experimenting with Astro and feeling way 
out of my depth, Kevin Powell's tutorial with 11ty has helped tremendously in 
breaking everything down and showing how to piece everything together. I think 
I prefer Astro oveerall as a templating set up but 11ty works smoohtly for now!

Set up Identity for Netlify even though it's been depreciated... I couldn't 
figure out Auth0 just yet so at some point in the near future, I need to sort
this out. All in all it feels so amazing to have a CMS that directly adds my
posts to my site! It is SO COOL.

Offically attached the CMS and fixed some CSS styling! It looks so much better now.

**_Things to do next:_**
- format blog post/list cards to include tags
- fix overall post page... right now I have a white background and nothing else
- figure out how to add a commenting section for posts
- build out a new page to provide more information on my glossary project
- look into SEOs? Not too worried about this at the moment. 
- Figure out how to use Auth0 instead of Identity

OH MY the world of Nunjucks is wild... probably not the best first choice 
for site building. However, following a Kevin Powell tutorial has been (mostly)
straitforward. Running into a problem with presenting the markdown files for 
blogposts onto the site with proper formatting... not sure why it's not working.
Will be rewatching the video to see if I missed any steps and do some 
googling from there!
