Got off the coding train during May. I had great plans, but I also had to earn money. Teaching has taken its toll even though I adore my students so much. I'm mentally exhausted. Knitting comes in as a sort of clarity. A sort of relaxation. A sort of peace. Nothing can replace hand-craft and creative, tangible work.

So I began knitting cables for the first time.  Turns out, cables are a dream to knit. You know what's not a dream? Math. Counting and estimates. I thought I was being clever because I knit a swatch with one whole whopping size smaller circular needles than recommended (I only have 3 knitting needle sizes to my name and was too impatient to purchase another size), took measurements, sized up, and lengthened the body of the top by 3cm to compensate. Wow, she's a mathematician!
\

This sorta-kinda worked. Sorta in that the length of the body is much better (though it could still be longer). Kinda in that I also applied the 3cm addition to the top of the shoulders, leaving me with a massive plunging neckline. Even if I added the ribbing, the design would've looked completely off. So, to guesstimate again and undo rows of work to readjust. 
\
\
However, this pattern was truly a dream to work with. Cables are so much fun to knit. I also learned how to do a tubular bind-off! It leaves such a lovely finish to the work and I'm a big fan.  A full post about this top is coming once I manage to take better photos of it. However, I'm very pleased with the final result and only managed to find one mistake deep into the knit where it will perpetually live.
\

May was cables month and birthday month and existential crisis month. I came to the realization that while the art and beauty I'm drawn to is colorful and happy and my demeanor is often the same, I am a true emo child at heart... something that makes me chuckle and also explains a lot of the struggle ahahahaha
\
\
Anyways, a bit demotivated from coding during May. The learning curve is great and I feel that I would greatly benefit from being mentored and working on projects with others to continue developing. Hoping to find more opportunities for collaboration in the future but for now, I'm planning on carving out time each week to devote to learning and developing my knitting app.

My languages have also been lacking lately. Work and trying to figure out next steps career-wise have taken priority. But last week, I walked into a record shop and found this French learning record! Instant purchase. Now I just gotta buy a record player... something to listen to while working on my next fiber arts project!
