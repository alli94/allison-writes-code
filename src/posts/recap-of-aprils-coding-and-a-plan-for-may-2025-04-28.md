Finally got everything sorted! Well almost everything. My perfectionist eye sees every single little detail that needs adjustment. And boy are there plenty of elements that need adjustment. The amount of bugs I ran into and errors from random things not compiling correctly on one day vs another, who knew a static website could hold so many lessons. I've loved every minute of tweaking this website and the tweaks ain't over yet. However, I'm realizing these things are relatively  easy to fix and they aren't always a priority. If you spend too much time focusing on the details, the overall project will never be realized. 

That being said, I do truly love CSS. I relied heavily on it for the styling of pretty much every layout and component feature. It gives me peace of mind knowing that in the future, all I have to do are a few tweaks and those little formatting issues will be resolved.

After trying my hardest to figure out JAMSTACK commenting, I had to admit defeat and realize I was a little out of my depth. My code was getting messy, I couldn't find anything, and the backend would not work no matter what I tried. The concept is very cool though and at some point, I'd like to figure it out. After a bit of research, I decided to go with a commenting feature that is easy to incorporate into the site. I settled on CommentBox.io which was ridiculously simple to set up. There's just something about it I'm not liking exactly. Maybe it just needs some styling? Commento might be a better fit for the "feel" I'm going for, so gotta experiment.

Oh! And I generated a cute little logo with ChatGPT. I'm excited to incorporate it into the site but even though I gave ChatGPT the hex color code, the logo is more cool-toned than how the same color appears on my site. Not sure how that happened and how to fix it, exactly.. maybe if I use the color-picker tool on Mac to test if the actual hex colors are, in fact, the same? A problem I was not expecting to have at all haha.

Overall, nothing too major to sort out at the moment.

All this to say, for the month of May I have a few goals to tweak my site:

1. Do some styling on the comment box
2. Figure out the logo color issue so it can be incorporated into my navbar
3. Create a favicon file to use for the site as well!
4. Fix gif responsiveness in the about page because it's not centering correctly on smaller screen sizes.

The next post is gonna focus on my plan for a few projects I've been dying to create. Now that I have my own, completely coded website, launched on the interwebs by myself... what???!! The fun stuff can begin.
