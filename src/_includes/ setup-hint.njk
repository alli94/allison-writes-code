It looks like you are just setting this up in a new site on Netlify. Woohoo!

{% if environment["Allison_Writes_Code"] %}
  {% set envHelpLink = "https://app.netlify.com/sites/" + environment["Allison_Writes_Code"] + "/settings/deploys#build-environment-variables" %}
{% else %}
  {% set envHelpLink = "https://docs.netlify.com/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables" %}
{% endif %}

You'll just need to ensure the [required environment variables]({{ envHelpLink }}) are set for your site before everything will work.

{% if not environment["NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN"] %}
üëâ `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`

{% endif %}

{% if not environment["SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"] %}
üëâ `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

In order to have the notifications appear in Slack, you'll need to create a Slack app with a webhook URL. [Here's how](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
