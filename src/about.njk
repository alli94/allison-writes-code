    <h1>Hello, 안녕하세요, こんにちは world!</h1>
    <p>I'm Allison — a language learning dev & creative, building useful things with code. I love exploring how creativity and tech can merge to create helpful tools for the makers of the world. This is a space for me to share my thoughts, projects, and experiments — from front-end flurry (no really... the hours I spend on UI related stuff is wild) to the behind-the-scenes building of my dream app for fiber artists and hobbyists.</p>
    <p>This space will also be for potential computational lingustics projects I have in mind, rants about urban development and sustainability, research on various langauge related topics, and occasional whimsy writings thrown in because why not ✨</p>
    <p>Here's to coding, to making, to creating!</p>
